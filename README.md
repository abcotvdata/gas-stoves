# Gas stoves

## Background

Nationwide, more than 40 million households, about 35%, cook with gas stoves, according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Housing Survey.  

Among large metro areas, Los Angeles and Riverside have the highest percentages of households that have gas stoves – about 81%, followed closely by Chicago at 79% and New York City at 73%.

A recent study out of Sanford shows that annual methane emissions from all gas stoves in U.S. homes have a climate impact comparable to the annual carbon dioxide emissions from 500,000 cars, and that more than three-quarters of the methane emissions were from when the stove was off. The stoves also emitted other health-damaging air pollutants like nitrogen oxides, which can trigger respiratory diseases.  

And while many older homes/buildings use piped gas for cooking (about half of homes built in 1939 or earlier use gas) the low is actually among homes built in the ‘70s, ‘80s, and ‘90s. About 44% of homes built in 2018 or 2019 (the most current year available).

## Data
The data in ths repo comes from the [U.S. Census Bureau's American Housing Survey](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/ahs/data/interactive/ahstablecreator.html?s_areas=00000&s_year=2019&s_tablename=TABLE1&s_bygroup1=1&s_bygroup2=1&s_filtergroup1=1&s_filtergroup2=1).

There are two tables, one is has the number (in thousands) and percent of household units using different kinds of cooking fuel by income level for the 14 largest metros in the U.S. and the nationwide data. The other has the same information, but by year built. Please note that some data is not available or suppressed by the Census Bureau due to sample size.
